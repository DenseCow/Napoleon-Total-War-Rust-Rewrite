# For the user

The morning report from night sessions, newest night first. Two lists per night:

- **Needs you:** in-game checks, debugger sittings, decisions. One line each: what, why, exact command.
  Tell Claude the result; it records it where it belongs and deletes the line.
- **Done tonight:** everything finished, merged or settled. One line each: what, commit, how to see it.
  Claude clears a night's list once the user has read it.

## Day of 2026-10-09 — needs you (batched; any time)

- **Debugger sitting, gait (~10 min, next session):** the original under Ghidra's debugger, a custom land battle with line
  infantry and cavalry. Claude logs two reads while you order cavalry to walk, then infantry walk → run → walk (the
  reads and breakpoints are at the end of analysis/fidelity/UNITS_TERRAIN_FIDELITY.md §1.10). Settles why our
  walk-ordered cavalry trots and which code switches infantry walk/run.

## Night of 2026-10-07

### Needs you

Base command: `cargo run -p napoleon -- <flags>`. The full check list is under HANDOFF "Needs an in-game check".

- **Attribute icons, agents:** (generals done 2026-10-07: match) `--campaign eur_napoleon --campaign-faction
  france --no-intro`, click a spy: its card shows the spying picture. Compare with the original.
- **Promote panel:** same command, select an army → Promote. Centred over the HUD, bottom on the band.
- **Agent actions:** same command, agent card → Assassinate / Duel opens a target picker; compare success %.

### Usage tonight

- Start: week 9.0% used; today's allowance 14% (night stop 12.5%). Weekly reset: Wed 2026-10-14 00:00.
- 5-hour window: 34% at 03:5x, refreshes 05:10. If it fills first, the session resumes at 05:13.

### Done tonight

The night stopped at 04:4x on today's allowance (week 11%). **No branch was merged**: all three
blockers went through many review rounds and each still had findings at the stop. Nothing new to
test on main tonight. Where each stands (details in docs/HANDOFF.md "Open bugs"):

- **Closing panels** (`work/blocker-panel-close` @ `f3b440f`): fixed in the real game (Lists and
  Technology close). One short final review, then merge.
- **Walls** (`work/blocker-walls`): walls are the last construction card, road on its own tab,
  damaged walls can't be upgraded, the AI builds and repairs walls. Was replacing the slot
  placeholder with a proper type (the cause of a crash) when the night stopped.
- **Battle music** (`work/battle-music-loop`): redesigned, looping music decoded fully before it
  plays; last review's 8 findings were being fixed at the stop.
- **Rules added:** code-quality rules, push guard (no pushes to main outside your PC), never change
  the branch of the main checkout, night resume rule (resume after a 5-hour-window stop, never after
  today's allowance), unattended debugger runs at night.
- **Settled:** "Small Star Fort" = walls level 1, last construction card (debugger + you). Recruitment
  tab bug confirmed in our build. Debugger launch fixed (working directory).
